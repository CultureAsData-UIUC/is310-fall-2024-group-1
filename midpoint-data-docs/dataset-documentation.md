# Semester Project Midpoint - Data Documentation

For our semester long project, our group aims to explore Flashpoint Archive's collection of Adobe Flash games and focus on the portrayal of women across various dress-up games pre and post-2011. 
## Dataset Overview
This dataset contains multiple variables collected from the chosen games. We collected the name of the game, 
the year it was published, the developer, the publisher, the genders you could choose from, the number of skin tones, 
and a link to the game. Most of that data was to establish context for the game, like what year it was created and who created 
it. The two categories that contained the main data we were trying to gather were gender and number of skin tones, as we were trying 
to track how those numbers changed throughout the years. All of our data was collected from the FlashPoint archive. 

**Content Description**: Your documentation should also provide a clear description of what the dataset contains. This includes an overview of the data fields,
 the type of information represented, and any relevant context. If your dataset is compiled from multiple sources, be sure to explain how these sources were 
 combined and reconciled.


### Team Responsibilities
- Project Manager for this Checkpoint: Ellis
- Controlled Vocabulary & Search Methods: A.G. & Divya
- Data Collection: Thea, Ellis, A.G., Divya
    - We each collected 4 games off of the Flashpoint archive, with Ellis & A.G. collecting 8 total games, post-2011, and Divya and Ellis collecting games from pre-2011.
- Data Analysis: 
- Documentation Creation: Our documentation is a collective effort between all members of the group, and is updated and revised across various points of the project lifecycle.

## Sourcing Games: Flashpoint Archive Search
Due to the lack of tabular directories on Flashpoint Archive's API, our group chose to create a controlled vocabulary to utilize the pre-existing search engine on 
the platform. 

## Collecting Data
- (Requirement) Alongside your dataset, you must submit documentation that details the process of data collection and the choices your group made along the way. 
This should include explanations of how you gathered the data, any challenges you encountered, and the criteria you used to include or exclude certain data points. 
You are encouraged to cite readings and materials from class to support your rationale.
