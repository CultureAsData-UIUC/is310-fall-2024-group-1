This dataset provides detailed information on Adobe Flash dress-up games, including their titles, release years, operability status, developers, publishers, available skin tones, game links, and screenshots. It serves as a resource for analyzing trends in diversity and representation within dress-up games, particularly by examining the evolution of skin tone options over time. To use this dataset effectively, start by filtering games based on their operability status to identify those available for further exploration. Utilize the "Number of Skin Tones" column to analyze diversity and compare it across different developers, publishers, or release years. The "Game Link" and "Screenshots" columns allow for a deeper dive into the visual and interactive elements of each game. For expanded research, consider comparing this dataset with others from different genres, such as adventure or role-playing games, to explore how diversity trends vary across gaming categories. Additionally, researchers could integrate this data with external datasets, such as societal or cultural trends, to examine broader influences on game design and inclusivity.
