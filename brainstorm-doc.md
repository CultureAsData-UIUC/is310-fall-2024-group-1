# First Brainstorming Document

This document is a Markdown version of our original Google Docs document, where our group first began brainstorming our digital object.

1. What might be considered a digital object or digital representation for your area of focus? You can have multiple examples, but you should explain why you consider it relating to your area of focus (this can be short though).
    - **Flash Animations and Games**: These would be the main examples of our area of focus. Some specific examples that are very commonly known include Cool Math Games, Girlsgogames, and Miniclip.
    - **Archived Websites**: Specific websites that were built around Flash technology can be considered digital representations. 
    - **Emulation Projects (e.g., Ruffle)**: Emulation software like Ruffle that mimics the behavior of Flash Player can also be seen as digital representations. They are crucial for my focus area as they provide a way to access and interact with Flash content on modern platforms, ensuring its longevity despite the discontinuation of the original technology.

2. How are digital objects and representations created for your area of focus? What are the processes involved in digitizing these objects? In the African American Periodical Poetry (1900-1928) dataset, we learned about the process of digitizing periodicals and Kahle also mentioned a process called OCR, Optical Character Recognition, for extracting text from digitized print materials. What are some of the digitization processes for your area of focus?

    Flash games are already digital objects, but their process of preservation is slightly different than web-crawling and preserving instances of the website. According to the DeviantArt tutorial, users have to download flash games or other flash-based artwork as .swf files, and if they wish to run them, an offline flash emulator would be required.

3. Kahle repeatedly made reference to the Library of Alexandria in his article. What are some historical equivalents to digital objects in your area of focus? How do these historical objects compare to their digital counterparts?

    - It is hard to come up with a historical equivalent to this digital object, but the best I can think of is: Flash games = Hieroglyphics, and flash emulators = the Rosetta Stone.
        - **Why?**: The flash games are no longer operable due to the evolution of software, as well as the obsolescence of Adobe Flash– similar to how the evolution into modern language rendered us incapable of understanding linguistic remnants of Ancient Egypt. The emulators enable current users’ devices to interpret the .swf file type, and run the games; similarly, the Rosetta Stone allows us to interpret Egyptian hieroglyphs as well as other written scripts. 

4. Relatedly, are there examples of born-digital materials for your area of focus? How do these materials compare to digitized objects? For those unfamiliar, born-digital materials are those that were created digitally and never existed in analog or physical form (think most social media, for example).

    - Description: Flash objects were made entirely on computers using tools like Adobe Flash. They never existed as physical objects; they were always digital, found in formats like .swf files or on websites like Newgrounds or Miniclip.

    - Comparison to Digitized Objects: Unlike things that started as physical objects and were later turned into digital versions, Flash objects were always digital from the start. They make full use of the interactive features that digital technology allows, which can’t be copied in non-digital forms. Flash content is designed to be digital, using code, interactivity, and multimedia elements that you wouldn’t find in digitized versions of physical objects.


5. What is the oldest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your area of focus? How has this resource been maintained and updated over time? You may also include examples that are no longer maintained or have been abandoned.
- Oldest Digital Archives:
    The Internet Archive appears to be one of the oldest and most comprehensive digital archives preserving Flash content:
    The Internet Archive has been archiving Flash animations and games since the early days of Flash.
- They use tools like Ruffle, a Flash emulator, to allow playback of archived Flash content in modern browsers without the Flash plugin.

6. Conversely, what is the newest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your area of focus? How does this resource compare to older digital libraries or archives?

    **__Newest Preservation Efforts__**
    - Some of the newest preservation efforts for Flash content include:
        - Ruffle - An open-source Flash emulator built with Rust and WebAssembly that allows Flash content to run in modern browsers without plugins.
        - Flashpoint - A project that has preserved over 100,000 Flash games and animations. (Specifically for games)
        - Oldweb. today - A service that incorporates Ruffle to emulate older web technologies like Flash.
    - Comparison of Old and New Approaches
        - Older approaches relied on archiving the Flash files (.swf) themselves, which became unplayable as Flash support ended.Newer approaches like Ruffle aim to emulate Flash functionality directly in the browser, allowing preserved content to remain accessible long-term.
    Modern preservation efforts are more comprehensive, aiming to save not just individual files but entire ecosystems of Flash content.

    **__Maintenance and Updates__**
    The Internet Archive has continually updated its preservation methods, adopting new technologies like Ruffle as they become available.
    Projects like Flashpoint are actively maintained by volunteers who continue to add new preserved content.
    Institutional archives like the Smithsonian are working to preserve their Flash-based content through various methods including web crawling and file acquisition



7. Are there any examples of your digital object that have gone viral? How did this happen and what impact did it have on the object or the digital library/archive that hosted it?
    Papa’s games go viral on websites like youtube through video game playthroughs → more website traffic → more variations of the game created → adobe flash gets abandoned, games stop working 
    Poptropica becomes more popular → more website traffic → more worlds and expansions of games 

8. Can you find any examples of free vs. proprietary digital libraries or archives for your area of focus? How do these resources differ in terms of access?
    Free examples of digital libraries are websites like CoolMathGames, GirlsGamesGo, Disney, and Nickelodeon. None of these websites require you to pay money to have access to the games. Flashpoint archive is an example of a free digital library as well. In some of these websites, you must watch ads to have access to the content.
