### Computational method: ImagePlot
- **Author**: Cody Mejeur, University at Buffalo SUNY, in Vol. 14 No. 3 of the Digital Humanities Quarterly (2020). https://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000486/000486.html 

## Key Concepts
- Mejeur introduces his experiences in playing PT (horror game); limitations to narrative related to hardware, software, platform, etc
    - Another  academic argues that there is a “apparent incompatibility between plot and interactivity”
- Ludonarrative: Concepts that “unites storytelling with the emergent qualities of play”
- Looks at structures of games & intersections in video games and other media

- **MAIN CONCEPT**: Assessing a new method for using video recordings of gameplay thrus to study “similarity, difference, and variation in narrative” as a result of the player’s interaction and choices
- **USES**: ImagePlot macro for ImageJ; Allows for analysis of visual media such as paintings, photos, film, and video games
    - Extracts images from video recordings, and plot on graph so it is entirely seen on one image (REFER @ FIG 1)
    - LEARN HOW IT WORKS: Imageplots as Visual Archives
        - X-axis of time, and randomly generated y-axis
        = No code, it involves files that will be run with ImageJ
    - Running the macro: Need a collection of images & an associated file/spreadsheet with filenames of images & any other needed data (ex: saturation or hues)
Generated by: Video files downloaded from YT, each of them were a video game playthrough

**GOAL of STUDY**: “locate patterns in the visual signs between playthroughs, and to thereby identify both the common and different meanings, experiences, and possibilities in a game”
    -Game choice: Horror games
    - Chose only one genre because of its tendency to limit player actions to nurture fear in the narrative (“hypothetically fewer variations between playthroughs”)
    - Used YT videos and Twitch Streams!!! → Excluded playthroughs with heavy editing bc of the bias it introduces
        - All plotted to be THE SAME SIZE, regardless of length of time 
- **Analyzing**: Variance in time, and variance in signs
        - Time: How long it takes to perform specific sequences in the game
        - Signs: Encountering different objects or encounters in a narrative; their absence or presence
