Computation Method: Image Recognition (Machine Learning)
Cultural Data: Social Media Photographs

In the article, researchers discussed wanting to use photos from social media to understand how people appreciate nature (like through recreational activities) in Singapore. But analyzing these photos manually would take too long, so they used machine learning to automate the process. They gathered over 20,000 photos from Flickr, a social media site where users share photos. These photos were tagged with location information (geo-tagged), so they knew where each photo was taken in Singapore. They used a machine learning tool called Google Cloud Vision to analyze each photo. This tool automatically identified what was in the photos and added keywords (like "plant," "animal," "food," etc.) to describe them. They looked at where the nature photos (like of plants and animals) were most commonly taken. They found that photos were concentrated around certain places in Singapore, like parks and nature reserves. They created a model to understand what factors influenced where nature photos were taken. They looked at things like, how close the photo was to popular tourist spots and how much greenery (like parks or forests) was nearby. This automated method can be used to quickly map and study how people interact with nature, helping urban planners understand which areas people value for nature activities. 
What I found interesting was how the researchers were able to leverage automated content analysis of social media photos, allowing researchers to analyze vast amounts of data (over 20,000 photos in this case) much more quickly and efficiently.  Just as the researchers used Google Cloud Vision to analyze social media photos, we can use similar image recognition tools to automatically analyze screenshots or images from the Flash dress-up games. The image recognition tool can identify elements like skin tone, clothing, hair styles, and other visual features in the characters. By processing the images of characters in the Flash games, we can track how different features appear in the games before and after 2011.

4. For our group project, we are thinking of using image recognition and machine learning (ML) to extract skin colors from Adobe Flash game screenshots. This method will allow us to analyze the diversity of characters, specifically how skin tones are represented, in dress-up games over time.

Cultural Data: Number of skin tones in video games (numeric)
	For cultural data, I wanted to look into the numeric value of skin tones present in video games throughout multiple years. I chose Reexamining Avatars of Whiteness: Changes in Racial Presentation of Video Game Player Characters as my scholarly article. This article examines whether or not racial diversity in video games has increased over the years, and how outside cultural events, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, have affected these numbers. To find the data for the article, the writer gathered the number of skin color options from multiple MMPORGSs. The data was gathered from MMPORG.com and Gamespot. Of the 85 games that were chosen for the study, you could not customize  your skin color in 16 of them. This data was then compared to 2009, in which 40% of games wouldnâ€™t have let you change your skin color, showing an improvement. There were also more options for african hair styles seen in the games sampled in the most recent study rather than the one done in 2009. The conclusion the author of the study came to was that the number of skin colors available in games has increased since 2009, there is still a noticeable lack of options for black characters in video games, especially as seen in facial features and hair styles. The number of options for non-white characters in video games reflects the cultural ideals at the time they were created and the dominance of whiteness in culture.
	The most interesting part of this scholarly article, to me, was the discussion of cultural context and how that could cause a shift in the number of skin tones available in video games. We can use the same practice that the researcher did for our own data. We can use online databases of dress up games that already exist and compare the number of skin tones by year, allowing us to see trends over time. This will also make it easier for us to examine how dress up games were impacted by the social culture at the time. 

We chose this method because it enables us to automatically process a large number of game screenshots, saving significant time compared to manual analysis. By leveraging image recognition tools and pre-trained ML models, we can efficiently identify and classify different skin tones in the characters. This will help us track how the representation of diverse skin tones has evolved before and after 2011 in the games.
