# Culture As Data: Part 1
This document covers Part 1 of the 2nd phase of our project, Culture As Data. See Pt. 2 for the AI reflection.

## Our Datasets
Dataset: [Flashpoint Archive](https://flashpointarchive.org/), divided between 2 time periods:
- Pre 2011: Prior to Stage3D
- Post 2011: Release of Stage3D, allows for 3D rendering on Flash [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=UGD4zMFnK0QC&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false)

For our dataset, we intend to use the 150,000+ games stored within the Flashpoint archive.Our focus is specifically on "Customization Games", such as dress up games, make-up, room decoration, character creation, etc. 
- __**Why this dataset?**__: Our group originally intended to use Internet Archive and Flashpoint archive as comparative datasets, until we realized that IA only had 5,000+ Flash games, while Flashpoint had over 150,000 Flash games *alone*, not even counting Flash-based images/media. We felt that using Flashpoint games, and dividing up the archive by time period would make a better comparative dataset because it is much more robust, and its metadata is provided in tables. 

## Reflection Questions

1. How do these datasets differ in how they represent cultural objects or practices?
Compare how the digital object itself and the dataset convey the same cultural artifact. What details are maintained, and what are simplified or lost?

The datasets are presented pretty similarly on flashpoint and Internet Archive. It follows basically the same format of tabular data, such as the release date, who it was from, and other details. Screenshots are also consistently provided alongside games in both datasets. The way games portray people is a major difference between pre 2011 and post 2011 dress up games. An example of data that has been lost is information about the way a game was indexed on its source website, which could have been useful in analysis. 

2. What kind of metadata or context accompanies the data?

The metadata that accompanies the data follows the same format pre and post 2005. Details such as release date, playmode, author, and status are all available. The flashpoint archive also has a tagging system that provides further context for what you’re looking at. A lot of the uploads to the website also include descriptions of the games. 

3. Does the dataset reflect any power structures or biases?

Flashpoint Archive is the brainchild of an Australian man, who was able to grow the archive into a community of thousands within the span of months; that is not to say that the archive's persepctive is infalliable. It is difficult to tell whether or not one language, or one developer is prioritized over others and is overrepresented in the dataset-- This is due to the nature of Flashpoint's website, which uses a search engine to find games, rather than indexed pages.

In reference to some of the customization games present: A lot of the dress up games in the data set, white people’s perspectives are centered. The cover images for games are white people. The default skin once you enter the game is usually white, and if the game does offer didn’t skin colors, options are limited. The narrative being promoted is the idea that white people/euro-centric features are the ‘beauty standard’. The narrative that girls are more interested in dress up games is also being promoted, as most of these games are very clearly geared towards women. 

4. Are there any notable gaps in the data?

The Flashpoint archive is undoubtedly an extensive collection, but it will inevitably have gaps. Flashpoint Archive is entirely volunteer run, and works quite similarly to a Zine library in the sense that the volunteer archivists collect Flash games that have been personally sourced on the internet, or have been "donated" or sent in by other creator/game enthusiast/etc. Within our group, and with our current understanding of Adobe Flash and related games, these are the gaps we predict may show up in our dataset.
- **Slight survivorship bias**: We are drawing conclusions based on the games that have been *saved*, yet there may be observations/conclusions that can be drawn specifically from the absence of other game genres/types
- **Untracable country of origin**: While the pioneer of Flashpoint Archive was Australian, not all the games in the archive are of Australian or American orign. There are several games from the Philippines created by indie developers that had made its way into the archive !(examples here)[https://newsbytes.ph/2021/02/02/pinoy-made-flash-indie-games-preserved-for-posterity-as-browser-support-ends/ ], and in our findings, there had been other games written in other languages (presumably Kanji/Japanese). Yet not all games in the archive have tracable roots to any one country. This metadata may be lost, simply due to technical limitations
