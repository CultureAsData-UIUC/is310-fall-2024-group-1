# Culture As Data: Part 1
This document covers Part 1 of the 2nd phase of our project, Culture As Data. See Pt. 2 for the AI reflection.

## Our Datasets
Dataset: Flashpoint Archive, divided between 2 time periods:
- Pre 2011: Prior to Stage3D
- Post 2011: Release of Stage3D, allows for 3D rendering on Flash https://books.google.com/books?id=UGD4zMFnK0QC&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false 

For our dataset, we intend to use the 150,000+ games stored within the Flashpoint archive.Our focus is specifically on "Customization Games", such as dress up games, make-up, room decoration, character creation, etc. 
- __**Why this dataset?**__: Our group originally intended to use Internet Archive and Flashpoint archive as comparative datasets, until we realized that IA only had 5,000+ Flash games, while Flashpoint had over 150,000 Flash games *alone*, not even counting Flash-based images/media. We felt that using Flashpoint games, and dividing up the archive by time period would make a better comparative dataset because it is much more robust, and its metadata is provided in tables. 

## Reflection Questions

1. How do these datasets differ in how they represent cultural objects or practices?
Compare how the digital object itself and the dataset convey the same cultural artifact. What details are maintained, and what are simplified or lost?

    > The datasets are presented pretty similarly on flashpoint and internet archive. It follows basically the same format of tabular data, such as the release date, who it was from, and other details. Screenshots are also consistently provided alongside games in both datasets. The way games portray people is a major difference between pre 2011 and post 2011 dress up games. An example of data that has been lost is information about the way a game was indexed on its source website, which could have been useful in analysis. 

2. What kind of metadata or context accompanies the data?

    > The metadata that accompanies the data follows the same format pre and post 2005. Details such as release date, playmode, author, and status are all available. The flashpoint archive also has a tagging system that provides further context for what you’re looking at. A lot of the uploads to the website also include descriptions of the games. 

3. Does the dataset reflect any power structures or biases? (THEA)
Discuss how the dataset’s structure, curation, or presentation reflects specific power structures. Consider who controls the dataset, what narratives it promotes, and whose perspectives are centered or marginalized.

    > In a lot of the dress up games in the data set, white people’s perspectives are centered. The cover images for games are white people. The default skin once you enter the game is usually white, and if the game does offer didn’t skin colors, options are limited. The narrative being promoted is the idea that white people/euro-centric features are the ‘beauty standard’. The narrative that girls are more interested in dress up games is also being promoted, as most of these games are very clearly geared towards women. 

4. Are there any notable gaps in the data? (AG)
Analyze what might be missing from the dataset that was part of the digital object. Why do you think this data is missing? Is it due to technical limitations, a lack of value, or active suppression?

    > The Flashpoint archive is undoubtedly an extensive collection, but it is inevitable to have gaps. Flashpoint Archive is entirely volunteer run, and works quite similarly to a Zine library in the sense that the volunteer archivists collect Flash games that have been personally sourced on the internet, or have been "donated" or sent in by other creator/game enthusiast/etc. Within our group, and with our current understanding of Adobe Flash and related games, these are the gaps we predict may show up in our dataset.



    The notable gaps in the data are the fact that we're probably operating with a survivorship bias, and we're only able to draw conclusions from the data that has been successfully preserved, and everything else is, for all intents and purposes, gone. We also cannot tell what countries of origin the games are from, unless the descriptions or the script of the gameplay is in another language.
