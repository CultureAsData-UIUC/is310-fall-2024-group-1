# IS310: Research Proposal

## Topic: Adobe Flash Games

Within our group, our shared area of cultural interest was aesthetics and internet subcultures. From there, we began brainstorming and chose to explore Adobe Flash games, specifically games that have been saved after the decommissioning of Adobe Flash in 2020. For the time being, we intend to keep a broader research question.
- __**Research Question**__: What patterns emerge across "Customization"-themed Adobe Flash games from pre-2011, and post-2011? 
    - Note: Customization games is a category we have coined as a group, referring to games involving dress-up, make-up, room customization, and character creation. This does not include RPG games with customization features.

## Materials

Due to the nature of our cultural artifact (Adobe Flash games), our group will not be handling any physical artifacts, as most of our media is already digitized and archived. 

Because most games within Flashpoint Archive are not operational online and must be run locally, we will likely have to download and run a Flash emulator on our computers if we wish to directly interact with the games. The archive offers an open-source Flash emulator for free, which is open for download to everyone. The community is active (with a Discord server of 31,000+ members) and many contributors, and looking at the docs, the mods have made sure that the emulator software will not trigger any problems with any anti-virus software that other users may have pre-installed on their machine. Overall, I say the open-source emulator is well maintained and can be a reliable tool for our research.

- ALTERNATIVELY: We can also download the Flashpoint Emulator, if we want to access all the collected games as a "gallery" (think: the UI of old game websites we used to access in 2008-2010). 

### __Potential limitations__:
- **Flashpoint Archive's search feature**: Sadly, Flashpoint's games are not indexed in such a way that allows for navigation by game category, and can only be accessed through the website's search bar. There are Smart Filters available, so that users can filter by Developer, Year, etc. Part of our responsibilities during our research may be to come up with search terms that will pull the most relevant results, and creating consistent filter settings to use across all queries.
- **Web Scraping Issues**: One thing about the Flash media saved in the archive is that all of its metadata (ex: Year released, Online pseudonym of the Developer, Date Uploaded, etc) is displayed as a table, placed below the preview screenshots of the game. This would be extremely useful to webscrape and analyze, but we are unsure if it would be possible to webscrape our queries on the Flashpoint Archive-- This is something we are currently trying to plan for.

## Division of Labor

In regard to our Project Manager rotation, our team plans on rotating the role of Project Manager every week, and handing off every Tuesday. 

Our rotation is set up as shown: 
- A.G.
- Divya Jain
- Ellis 
- Thea
- Zifan

Our group consists of 5 people, with each member holding respective strengths and unique domain knowledge.
