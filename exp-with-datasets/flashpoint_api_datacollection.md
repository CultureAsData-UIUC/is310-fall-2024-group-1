# Documentation: Preparing Data for Analysis in the Flashpoint Archive Project (Ellis)

## 1. Data Collection/Standardization

For this stage of the Flashpoint Archive project, I focused on refining a dataset of pre-2011 dress-up games. The dataset was initially stored as a CSV file, which I inspected to ensure all necessary columns and metadata were present. Using `csv.reader`, I validated the dataset structure, confirming that key attributes like `GAME_NAME`, `YOR` (Year of Release), `OPERABILITY_STATUS`, `DEVELOPER`, `PUBLISHER`, `GENDER`, `NO_OF_SKINTONES`, and `GAME_LINK` were correctly captured and free from non-printable characters.

The dataset was then converted into a pandas DataFrame for further inspection and cleaning. This included:
- Standardizing column names for uniformity.
- Ensuring all fields were populated with consistent and meaningful values.
- Verifying operability within the Ruffle emulator to determine if each game could be analyzed further.

After validation, the cleaned dataset was saved as `cleaned_dress_up_games.csv`.

## 2. Debugging and Scripting

To enrich our analysis, I wrote a script that connects to the Flashpoint Archive API to pull additional metadata. This step aimed to:
- Supplement the dataset with missing information.
- Provide a more robust foundation for analysis.

While the script successfully extracted data for several entries, debugging became necessary due to inconsistencies in certain API responses. Steps I took included:
- Logging API requests and responses to identify null values and unexpected formats.
- Iteratively improving error handling and data parsing in the script.

These adjustments will ensure that the final dataset is both comprehensive and accurate.

## 3. Reflection

This phase of the project emphasized the importance of thorough data validation and cleaning before conducting analysis. Key lessons include:
- The necessity of a clean, standardized dataset to avoid downstream errors.
- The iterative nature of working with external APIs, requiring adaptability and robust debugging methods.

The main takeaway was recognizing how foundational data preparation is to producing meaningful insights. This preparatory work will enable us to explore trends in operability, gender representation, and other factors in depth.

Moving forward, integrating cleaned data with additional metadata from the API will provide a richer context for understanding the evolution of dress-up games pre-2011. Expanding our feature set and refining our data collection methods will be crucial to unlocking deeper insights into the cultural and technological evolution of Flash dress-up games.
