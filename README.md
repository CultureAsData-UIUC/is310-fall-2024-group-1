To be updated with a description for a collaborative semester long project

## Tentative Group Members

These members were selected because of your broad interests in aesthetics (think art and design) and what might be described as the cultural industries, whether that's new digital cultures on social media or older ones that we are now digitizing. You are not required to keep your group focused on this area for this project, but I share this broad overview to hopefully help spark initial brainstorming together.

_Please note this list of members is tentative and subject to change as students join or leave the class in the next week or so._

- Divya J.
