One big barrier to information from Instagram is the limited amount of posts you can view without an account. After looking at a handful of posts, a pop-up will appear saying that you need to sign in to view more. This can be a large barrier to research and data collection. If youâ€™re trying to use some kind of automated data-scraping program, the necessity of a login/instagram account might interfere with this.
