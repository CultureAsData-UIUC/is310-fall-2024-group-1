Write about what research gaps this research addresses

The objective of engaging with dress-up games as our data set was to get a more concrete grasp of certain aspects of flash dress-up games changed over the span of years. We took games from pre-2011 and post-2011 and catalogued how many skin tones were offered, as well as what genre of game they were (anime, disney) so we could see if there was a noticeable difference between the two eras. We made sure to grab multiple games from each year in order to get a more detailed, accurate picture of trends.
The research gap our data set addresses is the relationship between cultural movements in real life and the number of skin tones and genre of dress-up games. For example, was there an uptick in skin color options in games following the emphasis on the Black Lives Matter movement after George Floydâ€™s death? Was there an uptick in Disney themed dress-up games after popular Disney movies such as Frozen were released? Our research allows us to see how large events or movements can affect the skin color diversity in dress-up games, which is important because they are largely used by younger generations.
